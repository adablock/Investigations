To integrate the Cardano Tip Bot with your Minecraft server using EssentialsX Discord, enabling Cardano Tip Bot commands to be sent from Minecraft to Discord, you’ll need to bridge the in-game chat or commands to interact with the Cardano Tip Bot on your Discord server. Below is a step-by-step guide to achieve this integration based on the provided information and the functionality of both systems.
Overview
EssentialsX Discord: This plugin provides a bridge between Minecraft and Discord, allowing in-game chat and commands to be relayed to a Discord channel and vice versa. It supports executing commands via Discord and can send in-game messages to specific Discord channels.
Cardano Tip Bot: This bot operates on Discord (and other platforms like Telegram) and responds to specific commands (e.g., /tip @DiscordUser <amount> <asset>) in public Discord channels to facilitate tipping ADA or tokens.
Goal: Enable players to send Cardano Tip Bot commands (e.g., /tip @user 1 ADA) from Minecraft, which are relayed through EssentialsX Discord to the Discord server where the Cardano Tip Bot can process them.
The challenge is that EssentialsX Discord primarily relays chat and specific commands, while Cardano Tip Bot expects commands in a Discord-specific format. You’ll need to configure EssentialsX Discord to send commands to the appropriate Discord channel and ensure the Cardano Tip Bot can interpret them.
Prerequisites
Cardano Tip Bot Installed: Confirm that the Cardano Tip Bot (Discord username: Cardano Tip Bot#7235) is added to your Discord server and is active in a public channel where tipping commands can be sent.
EssentialsX and EssentialsX Discord Installed: Ensure EssentialsX and its Discord module are installed on your Minecraft server (Spigot/Paper) and properly configured to communicate with your Discord server.
Permissions Plugin: Use a permissions plugin like LuckPerms to manage command access (recommended by EssentialsX).
Minecraft Server: Running a Spigot/Paper server compatible with EssentialsX (preferably Paper for performance).
Discord Developer Portal Access: You need access to the Discord bot settings for EssentialsX Discord to ensure proper configuration.
Steps to Integrate Cardano Tip Bot with Minecraft via EssentialsX Discord
1. Verify Cardano Tip Bot Setup
Ensure the Cardano Tip Bot is active in a public Discord channel (e.g., #tipping-channel) on your server.
Test the bot in Discord by sending a command like /tip @CardanoTipBot 1 ADA in a public channel to confirm it’s working.
Note the exact channel where the Cardano Tip Bot accepts commands, as you’ll need to relay Minecraft commands to this channel.
2. Configure EssentialsX Discord
EssentialsX Discord allows you to relay Minecraft chat and commands to Discord and execute commands from Discord. You’ll configure it to send specific in-game commands to the Discord channel where the Cardano Tip Bot is active.
Steps:
Ensure EssentialsX Discord is Set Up:
Follow the EssentialsX Discord setup guide (available at essentialsx.net/discord.html).
Create a Discord bot at discord.com/developers/applications, copy its Application ID and Token, and add it to your Discord server.
Enable Developer Mode in Discord to copy the server ID and channel IDs (Settings > Advanced > Enable Developer Mode).
Copy the ID of the Discord channel where the Cardano Tip Bot accepts commands (e.g., #tipping-channel).
In your Minecraft server’s plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml, set the guild-id to your Discord server’s ID and the primary-channel or a custom channel ID to the channel where the Cardano Tip Bot is active.
Configure Message Types:
In plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml, configure the message-types section to ensure player commands or chat are relayed to the correct Discord channel. For example:
yaml
message-types:
  player-chat: "tipping-channel-id"  # Replace with the ID of the channel with Cardano Tip Bot
  player-command: "tipping-channel-id"
This ensures that commands or chat from Minecraft are sent to the Discord channel where the Cardano Tip Bot can process them.
Enable Command Relaying:
In the config.yml, ensure the show-commands option is set to true for the commands you want to relay (or set globally to allow all commands to be visible in Discord). For example:
yaml
commands:
  tip:
    enabled: true
    show-commands: true
    allowed-roles: ["*"]  # Allows everyone to use the command
This configuration ensures that a /tip command in Minecraft is sent to the Discord channel.
Restart the Server:
After editing the configuration, restart your Minecraft server to apply changes (stop and then start in your server console or control panel).
3. Create a Custom Command in Minecraft
The Cardano Tip Bot expects commands in the format /tip @DiscordUser <amount> <asset> in Discord. To allow players to use a similar command in Minecraft, you can create a custom command using EssentialsX or a command alias plugin to format the command correctly for the Cardano Tip Bot.
Option 1: EssentialsX Custom Command:
EssentialsX supports custom command aliases in plugins/Essentials/config.yml. You can create an alias to format the Minecraft command to match the Cardano Tip Bot’s expected format.
Edit plugins/Essentials/config.yml and add a custom alias under the aliases section:
yaml
aliases:
  tip:
    - "msg $1 /tip @$2 $3 $4"
This alias allows players to use /tip <player> <amount> <asset> in Minecraft, which sends a private message to the EssentialsX Discord bot, formatted as a /tip command for the Cardano Tip Bot. For example, /tip Steve 1 ADA in Minecraft would send /tip @Steve 1 ADA to Discord.
Option 2: Use a Command Plugin:
If EssentialsX aliases don’t work as expected, consider using a plugin like CommandAPI or MyCommand to create a custom command that sends a formatted message to the Discord channel.
Example with MyCommand:
Install MyCommand (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mycommand.22272/).
Create a command in plugins/MyCommand/commands.yml:
yaml
tip:
  command: tip
  type: RUN_COMMAND
  runcmd:
    - '/discord sendmessage tipping-channel-id /tip @$1 $2 $3'
  permission-required: true
  permission: cardano.tip
This sends the command directly to the Discord channel (replace tipping-channel-id with the actual channel ID).
4. Link Minecraft and Discord Accounts (Optional)
To ensure the Cardano Tip Bot recognizes the Discord user associated with a Minecraft player, use the EssentialsX Discord Link addon to link player accounts:
Install the EssentialsX Discord Link addon (EssentialsXDiscordLink.jar) in your plugins/ folder.
Start the server to generate the configuration file (plugins/EssentialsDiscordLink/config.yml).
In Minecraft, players run /link to receive a code, then run /link <code> in Discord to link their accounts.
This step ensures that the Cardano Tip Bot can associate the Minecraft player’s command with their Discord user (e.g., mapping Steve to @Steve#1234).
5. Test the Integration
In Minecraft, have a player run the custom command, e.g., /tip Steve 1 ADA.
Check the Discord channel (#tipping-channel) to confirm that the EssentialsX Discord bot relayed the command as /tip @Steve 1 ADA.
Verify that the Cardano Tip Bot processes the command and responds in Discord (e.g., confirming the tip was sent).
If the bot doesn’t respond, ensure:
The command format matches exactly what the Cardano Tip Bot expects (/tip @DiscordUser <amount> <asset>).
The Discord channel ID in config.yml is correct.
The EssentialsX Discord bot has permissions to send messages in the channel (Manage Channels, Send Messages, Read Messages).
The Cardano Tip Bot is online and has the necessary permissions in the Discord channel.
6. Handle Permissions
Use LuckPerms to restrict who can use the /tip command in Minecraft:
bash
/lp group default permission set cardano.tip true
This ensures only authorized players can send tipping commands.
In Discord, ensure the Cardano Tip Bot has permissions to read and respond to messages in the target channel. You may also restrict who can use the /tip command in Discord by setting role-based permissions in the EssentialsX Discord config (allowed-roles).
7. Troubleshooting
Command Not Relaying: Check the message-types and commands sections in plugins/EssentialsDiscord/config.yml. Ensure show-commands is true and the channel ID is correct.
Cardano Tip Bot Not Responding: Verify the command format matches the bot’s requirements. Test the command directly in Discord to isolate issues. Ensure the bot is online (Cardano Tip Bot#7235).
Version Mismatch: Ensure EssentialsX and EssentialsX Discord are the same version (e.g., 2.20.1). Mismatched versions can cause issues.
Permissions Issues: Confirm the EssentialsX Discord bot has the necessary Discord permissions (Manage Webhooks, Send Messages, Read Messages) and that Privileged Intents are enabled in the Discord Developer Portal.
Logs: Check the server logs (logs/latest.log) for errors related to EssentialsX Discord or command execution.
8. Additional Considerations
Security: The Cardano Tip Bot warns about scams. Ensure players only interact with the official bot (Cardano Tip Bot#7235). Warn players not to send funds to unknown addresses.
Fees: The Cardano Tip Bot requires sufficient ADA to cover transaction fees (e.g., ~0.3 ADA per transaction). Ensure players deposit enough ADA (recommended: 3 ADA) to avoid issues.
Alternative Plugin: If EssentialsX Discord doesn’t meet your needs, consider DiscordSRV (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discordsrv.18494/), which some users report as more robust for Discord-Minecraft bridging. It supports similar chat/command relaying and may offer more flexibility.
Example Workflow
Player Steve runs /tip Alex 1 ADA in Minecraft.
EssentialsX Discord relays the command to the #tipping-channel in Discord as /tip @Alex 1 ADA.
The Cardano Tip Bot processes the command, checks Steve’s linked Discord account balance, and sends 1 ADA to Alex’s wallet, responding in Discord with a confirmation.
The confirmation message is relayed back to Minecraft via EssentialsX Discord (if configured).
Limitations
Command Format: The Cardano Tip Bot requires Discord-specific user tags (e.g., @Alex#1234). If players’ Minecraft usernames don’t match their Discord tags, you may need a mapping system (e.g., via EssentialsX Discord Link) to resolve this.
Bot Restrictions: The Cardano Tip Bot only processes commands in public Discord channels, so ensure the relay targets a public channel.
Performance: Relaying commands adds slight latency, and frequent tipping could strain the server or bot if not optimized. Consider rate-limiting commands with a permissions plugin.
